<p><em>“If you’re sailing across the ocean and your goal is to avoid weather and waves, then why the hell are you sailing?” he says. “You have to embrace that sailing means that you can’t control the elements and that there will be good days and bad days and that, whatever comes, you will deal with it”</em></p>

<p>We all have certain goals for ourselves which we want to achieve, some are long terms and some are short terms. If you have raised flags in all the mountains you wished for few years ago and instead of pating your back, you feel upset because somebody else have scaled a higher mountain than you in the same hour then my friend you are not alone and certainly need to write your script of life again. </p>
<p>From my perspective, the job of a software engineer is very demanding. It exhausts your logic and maths to the core if you do not know how to take a break and if you won't keep yourself away from the money trap . This follows in almost every profession. I for myself, currently have most of the things I wished for as a freshman in the college but somehow I ended up by being upset about achieving less. Once while meditating I thought of re-writing the script of my life. I needed an anchor to look forward to.</p>
<p>I have a personal template which I keep for myself to write my script which mainly includes 2 sections</p>
<ul>
<li>What I am today</li>
<li>What I want to be tomorrow</li>
</ul>
<p>This covers the teeny tiny details of my current lifestyle and how I would want to improve it. I recently wrote my new script and seems like I am now a 6 am club member who reads a bit everyday. I thought of treating myself with love and obviously good food( I would have chose travelling but covid 19 has washed all my memories of it. Yikes!)</p>
<p>To have small goals for each day adds a sense of purpose and gives an aura of achievement every night when you end your day.
I hope you keep your mental health sane and physical health strong for the coming years since we are in a pandemic and who knows what is for the next!!</p>
