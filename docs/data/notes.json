Now that I work for [Dendron](https://www.dendron.so/) which is specially designed for notetaking,  I thought of dogfeeding and explore its features. So if this is the first journal that you are reading, then Welcome: We have just `Shri Ganesh'ed` my journal. \n\n![](/assets/images/2021-07-25-12-25-06.png)\n\nThis is me - Harshita Joshi, born and brought up in India, working as a Software Engineer and planning to do my Masters in Computer Science. \n\nAlso for those of you wondering what shree ganesh is, it means to commence or inaugurate.\nThe reason behind calling inaugration as `Shree Ganesh` will make it a journal of itself.

If you have raised flags in all the mountains you wished for few years ago and instead of pating your back, you feel upset because somebody else have scaled a higher mountain than you in the same hour then my friend you are not alone and certainly need to write your script of life again. \n\nFrom my perspective, the job of a software engineer is very demanding. It exhausts your logic and maths to the core if you do not know how to take a break and if you won't keep yourself away from the money trap . This follows in almost every profession. I for myself, currently have most of the things I wished for as a freshman in the college but somehow I ended up by being upset about achieving less. Once while meditating I thought of re-writing the script of my life. I needed an anchor to look forward to.\n\nI have a personal template which I keep for myself to write my script which mainly includes 2 sections\n\n-  What I am today\n- What I want to be tomorrow\n\nThis covers the teeny tiny details of my current lifestyle and how I would want to improve it. I recently wrote my new script and seems like I am now a 6 am club member who reads a bit everyday. I thought of treating myself with love and obviously good food( I would have chose travelling but covid 19 has washed all my memories of it. Yikes!)\n\nTo have small goals for each day adds a sense of purpose and gives an aura of achievement every night when you end your day.\nI hope you keep your mental health sane and physical health strong for the coming years since we are in a pandemic and who knows what is for the next!!\n\n_Prost!_"
