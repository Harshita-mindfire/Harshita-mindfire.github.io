<p>I have tried multiple times to keep track of journals, but have failed miserably. The main culprit behind this is my habit of damaging mobile phones before their due date. Writing notes on my cell phone is probably the easiest way to keep track of notes but when you loose them and do not have a backup, you loose much. Now that I work for <a href="https://www.dendron.so/">Dendron</a> which is specially designed for notetaking,  I thought of dogfeeding and explore its features. So if this is the first journal that you are reading, then Welcome: We have just <code>Shri Ganesh'ed</code> my journal. </p>

<p>This is me - Harshita Joshi, born and brought up in India, working as a Software Engineer and planning to do my Masters in Computer Science. </p>
<p>Also for those of you wondering what shree ganesh is, it means to commence or inaugurate.
The reason behind calling inaugration as <code>Shree Ganesh</code> will make it a journal of itself. I might publish it someday, Till then tune in :)
